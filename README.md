# SpaceX-Falcon9-Landing-Prediction
Data Science Capstone Project: SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction.

Project main focus is on predicting the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings, utilizing data from SpaceXData API and Wikipedia.
After thorough data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using SQL and visualization techniques. The project identifies key factors influencing successful landings, explores environmental observations through Folium, and builds a dashboard. The predictive analysis employs various classification models, with the Decision Tree Classifier emerging as the most effective. Key findings include optimal launch sites, payload considerations, and the reliability of different orbits, providing valuable insights for cost estimation in rocket launches.
